### About the Project

The field of computer-aided design (CAD) has revolutionized
the way of designers and engineers conceptualize and create
complex 3D models and parts. However, effectively
communicating these intricate designs to stakeholders,
clients or colleagues can often be challenging, especially
when relying solely on static 2D renderings or technical
documentation.

Through this project, we aimed to bridge this gap by writing
a robust library for the OpenCASCADE geometric kernel
which can be used for creating automated cinematic
visualization of any input parts or CAD models.

The library we developed is comprehensive and is broadly
divided into two parts :
The first part is for creating and saving 3D models and parts
(along with a hierarchy if required) to the commonly used
formats such as OBJ, STEP and STL.
The second part of the library is meant to be used for creating
automated visualizations of the 3D parts generated by
OpenCASCADE using advanced rendering techniques, all
possible through a single script. As per the userâ€™s
requirements, several kinds of adjustments can be made to
the scene before rendering, and the output can be saved in
the commonly used image and video formats such as PNG,
JPG and MP4.
